    <h2>Autobiography</h2>
    <p class="autoiography">I am an experienced technical professional with a career spanning over 30 years. My journey
      began in Entertainment and News in the early 1990s, where I started as a production assistant and quickly advanced
      to positions such as Facility Engineer, Implementation Engineer, and Chief Engineer. I have worked at various
      studios, including NBC in Burbank, as well as smaller houses specializing in Marketing and Promotions.
      Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of collaborating with talented and dedicated professionals, gaining
      valuable insights into dedication and loyalty from both sides of the equation. Seeking a transition to a
      slower-paced industry, I joined Freudenberg Medical's IT department. Initially, I was appointed as the Master Data
      Migration Coordinator, traveling globally to implement SAP at their manufacturing plants. After successfully
      completing six implementations, I was promoted to build out the project management office and later became the
      cloud specialist, responsible for migrating local data arrays to the cloud and
      training users on best practices for Microsoft 365, particularly concerning cloud operations. In addition to
      managing the rollout of Copilot, I supported 1,200 users in all aspects of office software, tech support, and
      specialized in digitizing and automating business processes. Throughout these varied roles, I have always aspired
      to delve into the development side of technology. I have since gained proficiency in multiple programming
      languages and developed a unique style, demonstrating comfort
      in both individual and team-based achievements.</p>

      <h2>Project Management</h2>
      <h3>About me in Project Management</h3>
      <p>My introduction to Project Managemet derived from necessity in 1996 when I was Chief Engineer at Electric
        Entertainment, a small company with just over 100 employees in Santa Monica, Ca. 1996 was my first PM
        experience, and I was responsible for the emergeny Hollywoodrelocation to Century City with the requirement of
        completing the move between Friday end of business and back online Monday business open. I was responsible for
        all aspects of the project, from budgeting to scheduling to resource allocation. I learned quickly that the key
        to success in project management is effective, constant and effective communication with all stakeholders. Since
        then, I have managed:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>NBC Burbank: KNBC Building Post Production Infrastructure facility upgrade <em>Budget: 1.5M</em></li>

            1M</em></li>

      <h2>Business Process Automation</h2>
      <h3>About me in Automation</h3>
      <p>There are always those people everyone goes to for help. In the office, it's usually help with technology, in
        my life that has always been me. Being hired at Freudenberg Medical was no different. I was hired as Master Data
        Migrtion Manager for SAP, and I naturally took on that "helper" role as well. Helping every user with any IT
        issue, question, idea, need. Traveling from site to site with the SAP implementaitn team, by the time I was
        given the repoinsibility of building the PMO, I had nearly all 1,200 users coming to me for their software
        issues and I would provide solutions. Then when given the position Cloud Speciallist, I was also given the
        resposibility of implementing those solutions. Implementing SAP is an extremely expensive endeavor, surpassed
        only by the risk of a failed rollout removing that site from the company roster, so all solutions had to be
        implemented using only what was in our corporate catalog, which was mostly Microsoft as defined by their E5
        license. Also I am proud to include that all sites are still in business and prospering.</p>
      <p>Some of the processed I automated using the Microsfot PowerPlatform</p>

        <li>HSE Good Catch site reporting.</li>

        <li>CPIM PMO Metric presentations to the board of leadership</li>
