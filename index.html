          <p class="autobiography" id="autobiography">
            Technology professional with 30+ years of experience, my career journey began in the dynamic world of
            Entertainment and Broadcast News in the early 1990s. Rapid advancement at various studios, including NBC
            Burbank, and smaller firms specializing in Marketing and Promotion, saw me progress from Facility Technician
            to Chief Engineer. This experience instilled a deep appreciation for teamwork and dedication.
          </p>
          <p>Seeking a change of pace, I moved to Freudenberg Medical's IT department. As Master Data Migration
            Coordinator, I spearheaded the data migration for six global SAP implementations across their manufacturing
            plants. Subsequently, I established their project management office and evolved into a Cloud Specialist,
            migrating data to the cloud, training 1200 users on Microsoft 365 best practices, and leading the Copilot
            rollout.</p>
          <p>My expertise includes tech support, digitization, automation, and custom solutions. Now deeply interested
            in
            software development, which has been demonstrated through gaining proficiency in multiple programming
            languages and a proven ability to excel in both individual and team settings.</p>

            Software development is an important chapter in my career and represents the natural progression of my work:
            solving problems, improving systems and empowering people. With years of experience supporting businesses
            and users, managing projects, and automating processes, I understand that code is a crucial tool that
            connects
            vision to realization. Regardless of the technology, it is implemented, managed and completed through
            software. This field provides the opportunity to build solutions that scale from inception to completion and
            address real challenges. Previous experience has taught me how to manage deadlines, deliver value, and
            optimize
            processes. Software development allows for the application of these skills, guided by objectives and vision.
          </p>
          <p>Personality has a way of coming out in what we do, my core values are evident here: clarity, consideration,
            patience, and always working with the end in mind.</p>

        <h2>Project Management</h2>
        <div class="pm-container">
          <p>Project Management involves integrating people, processes, and technology to accomplish a common
            objective. It serves as the cohesive element that unifies all components. Having had the privilege of
            collaborating with some of the industry's foremost project managers, I have gained insightful knowledge from
            them. Additionally, my experience in leading projects has taught me that project management does not adhere
            to
            a singular approach. Each project is distinct and demands agility, a customized strategy, and thoughtfully
            planned risk mitigation to ensure its successful completion.</p>
          <h3>How PM applies in Software Development</h3>
          <p>While some may view planning in software development as a simple preliminary task, I assert that the phases
            of
            the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and those of Project Management are inherently interconnected. A
            meticulously executed SDLC functions as a comprehensive project plan — it is iterative, objective-oriented,
            and
            considers both scope and resource limitations.</p>
          <p>Having led projects within highly regulated industries, I possess the expertise to align SDLC phases with
            tangible milestones: Requirements correspond to stakeholder alignment, Development to team execution,
            Testing to
            risk mitigation, Deployment to delivery, and Maintenance to long-term value. The process extends beyond mere
            code creation — it encompasses the management of personnel, processes, and progress in unison.</p>
          <h3>History in Project Management</h3>
          <p>My journey into Project Management commenced out of necessity in 1996, during my tenure as Chief Engineer
            at
            Electric Entertainment, a company with over 100 employees in Santa Monica, CA. My initial experience with
            project management entailed overseeing the emergency relocation to Century City, which required completing
            the
            move between the close of business on Friday and reopening by Monday morning. I was accountable for all
            aspects
            of the project, including engineering the design and integration of the broadcast systems, installation of
            those
            systems, as well as managing the project schedule, budget, and resource allocation throughout the company.
            The
            project was successfully concluded, and I quickly realized that the key to success in project management
            lies in
            maintaining effective and constant communication with all stakeholders.</p>
          <p>Since then, I have project managed:</p>

          </div>
          <h3>History in Automation</h3>
          <p>There are always individuals who become the go-to people for assistance. In the office, this often pertains
            to
            technological support, and in my life, that individual has consistently been me. My employment at
            Freudenberg
            Medical followed this pattern. I was hired as the Master Data Migration Manager for SAP and naturally
            assumed
            the role of a helper, initially aiding the SMEs with their conversion tasks, shortly thereafter, any other
            IT
            issue, question, idea, or need.</p>
          <p>As part of the SAP implementation team, I traveled from site to site. By the time I was entrusted with
            building
            the PMO, nearly all the 1,200 users knew where they could come for “out of catalog” assistance for their
            software
            and configuration needs, and I provided effective solutions. Upon being appointed Cloud Specialist, I also
            undertook the responsibility of implementing these solutions.</p>
          <p>Implementing SAP is an exceedingly costly endeavor, second only to the significant risk of a failed
            rollout,
            which could result in the removal of a site from the company roster. Therefore, all solutions had to be
            implemented using only the resources available in our corporate catalog, predominantly Microsoft products as
            defined by their E5 license. I take pride in noting that all sites continue to operate successfully and
            thrive.
          </p>

          <h3>What all this means to me</h3>
          <p>My career has involved providing support to meet the evolving needs of the business and its users. In my
            previous position, I delivered these solutions globally for nearly a decade. This experience required
            reliance
            on tools that I supported but did not necessarily use myself. As a solution provider for the business, my
            responsibilities included facilitating efficiency, reliability, and flexibility through LEAN principles,
            systems
            design, integration, redesign, and re-integration as methodologies and technologies evolved.</p>
          <p>Although I could reconfigure routers, design converters, and rewire facilities, the software used often
            remained
            unchanged at a granular level. My involvement with basis programmers during their SAP implementations
            highlighted
            the significant impact of being able to reconfigure or design software as a solution. This experience
            motivated
            me to pursue a deeper understanding of software development. I am equally comfortable working on the
            frontend as
            I am on the backend. I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and proficiency in Python,
            Django,
            Node.js, Express, and React. Additionally, I have experience with various databases, including PostgreSQL
            and
            MongoDB.</p>
          <p>My familiarity with GitHub, Heroku, and Netlify has enabled me to manage and deploy projects effectively.
            My
            experience has given me a deep understanding of what it takes to succeed, which is the integration of
            theory,
            practice, and principle. Regardless of where I am in the lifecycle of a business, I possess a comprehensive
            perspective and appreciation for efficiency and accuracy. Success is achieved through meticulous planning,
            maintenance, and a continuous pursuit of excellence in every aspect of a business. There are no shortcuts or
            easier ways.</p>
          <h3>Bringing it all together</h3>
          <p>Each discipline complements the others—development builds and modifies, project management ensures focused
            and
            efficient efforts, and process automation not only delivers precision for current tasks but also lays the
            groundwork for future business initiatives. Together, they create a comprehensive cycle of continuous
            improvement.</p>
