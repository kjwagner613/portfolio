      <h2>Autobiography</h2>
      <p class="autoiography">Technology professional with 30+ years of experience, my career journey began in the
        dynamic world of Entertainment and Broadcast News in the early 1990s. Rapid advancement at various studios,
        including NBC Burbank, and smaller firms specializing in Marketing and Promotion, saw me progress from Facility
        Technician to Chief Engineer. This experience instilled a deep appreciation for teamwork and dedication. Seeking
        a change of pace, I transitioned to Freudenberg Medical's IT department. As Master Data Migration Coordinator, I
        spearheaded the data migration for six global SAP implementations across their manufacturing plants.
        Subsequently, I established their project management office and evolved into a Cloud Specialist, migrating
        on-premise data to the cloud, training 1200+ users on Microsoft 365 best practices, and leading the Copilot
        rollout. My expertise encompasses comprehensive tech support, process digitization and automation, custom
        application solutions and system design and implementation. Now deeply interested in software development, which
        has been demonstrated through gaining proficiency in multiple
        programming languages and a proven ability to excel in both individual and team settings.</p>

      <h2>Software Development</h2>
      <p>Software development is the newest chapter in my career and it is the natural evolution of everything I’ve
        done: solving real problems, improving systems and empowering people. After decades supporting businesses and
        users, managing projects and process automation , I recognize that code is not just a tool, it is the connective
        medium from vision to realization. No matter what technology, it is implemented, managed and completed through
        software. I came to this field because it gives me the opportunity to start at the beginning and build with the
        end in mind; solutions that scale, and solve real challenges. My past experience taught me how to manage
        deadlines,
        deliver value, and optimize processes. Software development lets me bring all of that point, directed and
        focused by intent, objectives and vision.</p>
      <p> I code the same way I lead: with clarity, with empathy, and always with the end in mind. </p>

        <h2>Project Management</h2>
        <h3>How PM applies in Software Development</h3>
        <p>While some may consider planning in software development a quick task, a pre-start option, I believe the
          phases of SDLC and those of Project Management are fundamentally intertwined. A well-executed SDLC is a
          project plan — it is iterative, goal-driven, and sensitive to both scope and resource constraints.
          Having led projects across highly regulated industries, I understand how to map SDLC phases to real-world
          milestones: Requirements to stakeholder alignment, Development to team execution, Testing to risk mitigation,
          Deployment to delivery, and Maintenance to long-term value.
          It is not just about writing the code — it is about managing people, process, and progress, all moving
          together.
        </p>


        <h3>History in Project Management</h3>
        <p>My introduction to Project Managemet derived from necessity in 1996 when I was Chief Engineer at Electric
          Entertainment, a small company with just over 100 employees in Santa Monica, Ca. 1996 was my first PM
          experience, and I was responsible for the emergeny Hollywoodrelocation to Century City with the requirement of
          completing the move between Friday end of business and back online Monday business open. I was responsible for
          all aspects of the project, from budgeting to scheduling to resource allocation. I learned quickly that the
          key
          to success in project management is effective, constant and effective communication with all stakeholders.
          Since
          then, I have managed:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>NBC Burbank: KNBC Building Post Production Infrastructure facility upgrade <em>Budget: 1.5M</em></li>
          <li>Cimarron Bacon Obirien: Digital conversion and facility upgrade to AVID non-linear edit suites.
            <em>Budget:
              1M</em>
          </li>
          <li>Storm Studios: Distribution of approved online elements for broadcast.</li>

          <p><strong>PM Classes with PMI in 2015-2016 and certification PMBOK ver. 5</strong></p>

          <li>Freudenberg Medical: Creation of PMO for newly projectized CPIM department</li>
          <li>Freudenberg Medical: Under CTO I wrote all procedures and trainined new PMs in use of custom SharePoint
            management tools whicdh I created using Microsoft Power Platform.</li>
          <li>Freudenberg Medical: Personnally managed as many as 7 concurrent IT infrastucre projects for 6 years while
            as PM.</li>
          <li>Freudenberg Medical: As cloud support specialist I continued to PM with the data migration from onpremise
            storage to cloud for 6 sites around the globe</li>
          <li>Freudenberg Medical: As cloud support specialist I managed the pilot group and rollout of Microsoft
            Copilot.

        <h2>Business Process Automation</h2>
        <h3>History in Automation</h3>
        <p>There are always those people everyone goes to for help. In the office, it's usually help with technology, in
          my life that has always been me. Being hired at Freudenberg Medical was no different. I was hired as Master
          Data
          Migrtion Manager for SAP, and I naturally took on that "helper" role as well. Helping every user with any IT
          issue, question, idea, need. Traveling from site to site with the SAP implementaitn team, by the time I was
          given the repoinsibility of building the PMO, I had nearly all 1,200 users coming to me for their software
          issues and I would provide solutions. Then when given the position Cloud Speciallist, I was also given the
          resposibility of implementing those solutions. Implementing SAP is an extremely expensive endeavor, surpassed
          only by the risk of a failed rollout removing that site from the company roster, so all solutions had to be
          implemented using only what was in our corporate catalog, which was mostly Microsoft as defined by their E5
          license. Also I am proud to include that all sites are still in business and prospering.</p>
        <p>Some of the processes I automated using the Microsoft PowerPlatform</p>
        <ol>
          <li>HR new employee onboarding.</li>
          <li>HSE Good Catch site reporting.</li>
          <li>Project Management Metrics</li>
          <li>GROWTTH Kaizen certification metrics</li>
          <li>CPIM PMO Metric presentations to the board of leadership</li>
          <li>Client access for product development</li>

        </ol>

      <section class="content" id="foundation">
        <h2>Foundation</h2>
        <h3>What all this means to me</h3>
        <p>My career has involved providing support to meet evolving needs of the business and the users responsible to
          achieve that objective.. In my previous position, I delivered these solutions on a global scale for nearly a
          decade. This experience required reliance on tools that I supported but did not necessarily use myself. As a
          solution provider for that businesses, my responsibilities included facilitating efficiency, reliability, and
          flexibility through LEAN principles, systems design, integration, redesign, and re-integration as
          methodologies and technologies evolved. While I could reconfigure routers, design converters, and rewire
          facilities, the software used often remained unchanged at a granular level. My involvement with basis
          programmers during an SAP implementation highlighted the significant impact of being able to reconfigure or
          design software as a solution. This experience motivated me to pursue a deeper understanding of software
          development. I am as comfortable working on the frontend as I am on the back. I have a solid foundation in
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am proficient in Python, Django, Node.js, Express, and React. I have also
          worked with various databases, including PostgreSQL and MongoDB. My experience with GitHub and Heroku has
          allowed me to manage and deploy projects effectively. My experience has given me a deep familiarity with what
          it takes to succeed, and that is the binding of theory, practice and principle. No matter where I am in the
          lifecycle of the business I am involved in, my experience allows me a full perspective and appreciation for
          efficiency and accuracy. Success is achieved with the well maintained, meticulously planned and continued push
          for excellence from every aspect of a business, there are no shortcuts, no easier way. </p>
      </section>

      <section class="tie-together" id="tie-together">
        <h2>Bringing it together</h2>
        <p>Each field enhances the others—development constructs and adapts, project management ensures effort is
          focused and efficient, and process automation not only provides accuracy for itself, but also potential future
          projects for the business. Together, they form a complete thoughtful cycle of continuous improvement.</p>
