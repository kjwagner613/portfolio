      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="biography">I am an experienced technical professional with a career spanning over 30 years. My journey
        began in Entertainment and News in the early 1990s, where I started as a production assistant and quickly
        advanced to positions such as Facility Engineer, Implementation Engineer, and Chief Engineer. I have worked at
        various studios, including NBC in Burbank, as well as smaller houses specializing in Marketing and Promotions.
        Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of collaborating with talented and dedicated professionals,
        gaining valuable insights into dedication and loyalty from both sides of the equation.
        Seeking a transition to a slower-paced industry, I joined Freudenberg Medical's IT department. Initially, I was
        appointed as the Master Data Migration Coordinator, traveling globally to implement SAP at their manufacturing
        plants. After successfully completing six implementations, I was promoted to build out the project management
        office and later became the cloud specialist, responsible for migrating local data arrays to the cloud and
        training users on best practices for Microsoft 365, particularly concerning cloud operations.
        In addition to managing the rollout of Copilot, I supported 1,200 users in all aspects of office software, tech
        support, and specialized in digitizing and automating business processes.
        Throughout these varied roles, I have always aspired to delve into the development side of technology. I have
        since gained proficiency in multiple programming languages and developed a unique style, demonstrating comfort
        in both individual and team-based achievements.</p>
