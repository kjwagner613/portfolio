        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="biography">I am an experienced technical professional with a career spanning over 30 years. My journey
          began in Entertainment and News in the early 1990s, where I started as a production assistant and quickly
          advanced to positions such as Facility Engineer, Implementation Engineer, and Chief Engineer. I have worked at
          various studios, including NBC in Burbank, as well as smaller houses specializing in Marketing and Promotions.
          Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of collaborating with talented and dedicated professionals,
          gaining valuable insights into dedication and loyalty from both sides of the equation.
          Seeking a transition to a slower-paced industry, I joined Freudenberg Medical's IT department. Initially, I
          was
          appointed as the Master Data Migration Coordinator, traveling globally to implement SAP at their manufacturing
          plants. After successfully completing six implementations, I was promoted to build out the project management
          office and later became the cloud specialist, responsible for migrating local data arrays to the cloud and
          training users on best practices for Microsoft 365, particularly concerning cloud operations.
          In addition to managing the rollout of Copilot, I supported 1,200 users in all aspects of office software,
          tech
          support, and specialized in digitizing and automating business processes.
          Throughout these varied roles, I have always aspired to delve into the development side of technology. I have
          since gained proficiency in multiple programming languages and developed a unique style, demonstrating comfort
          in both individual and team-based achievements.</p>
